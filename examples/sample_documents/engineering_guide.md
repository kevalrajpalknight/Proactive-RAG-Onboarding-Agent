# Engineering Team Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the TechCorp Engineering team! This guide covers our development practices, tools, and procedures that all engineers should follow.

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for all development work
- Create pull requests for code review
- Minimum 2 approvals required for production code
- Squash commits before merging to main

### Code Review Process
1. Create detailed pull request description
2. Include relevant tests and documentation
3. Address all reviewer feedback
4. Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes
5. Merge only after all approvals

### Branch Naming Convention
- Feature branches: `feature/TICKET-123-short-description`
- Bug fixes: `bugfix/TICKET-456-issue-description`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix/critical-fix-name`

## Technical Standards

### Code Style
- Follow language-specific style guides (PEP 8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript)
- Use automated formatting tools (Black, Prettier)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive code comments

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Performance tests for critical paths

### Documentation
- README files for all projects
- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Inline code documentation

## Tools and Technologies

### Development Environment
- Docker for local development
- Visual Studio Code recommended IDE
- Standard development VM images available
- Local environment setup scripts provided

### Programming Languages
- Python 3.9+ for backend services
- JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend
- SQL for database queries
- Go for performance-critical services

### Frameworks and Libraries
- FastAPI for Python web services
- React for frontend applications
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- Redis for caching and sessions

### Infrastructure
- AWS cloud platform
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines

## Security Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices
- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized queries for database access
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Regular security dependency updates

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Multi-factor authentication required
- VPN access for remote work

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Personal data handling protocols
- GDPR compliance requirements
- Regular security audits

## Onboarding for New Engineers

### Career Progression
- Technical track: Junior → Mid → Senior → Staff → Principal
- Management track: Team Lead → Engineering Manager → Director
- Regular performance reviews and feedback
- Promotion criteria clearly defined

### Performance Metrics
- Code quality and review feedback
- Feature delivery and reliability
- Team collaboration and communication
- Learning and skill development

## Emergency Procedures

### Production Issues
- On-call rotation schedule
