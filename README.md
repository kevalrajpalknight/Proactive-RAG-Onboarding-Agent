# Proactive-RAG-Onboarding-Agent

**A cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent built with LangChain to synthesize tailored, structured 30-day curricula for new corporate hires.**

## üåü Project Overview

This project tackles a common business challenge: **information overload** during employee onboarding. Instead of providing a static knowledge base, the **Proactive-RAG-Onboarding-Agent** leverages advanced Generative AI to act as a personalized curriculum planner.

It dynamically creates a step-by-step, 30-day learning and task agenda based on a new hire's specific **role** and **seniority**. This project demonstrates mastery of **Advanced RAG Architectures** and **Agent Orchestration**‚Äîkey skills for any modern AI/ML Engineer.

### Key Value Proposition

  * **Personalization:** Generates unique content for roles like "Junior Backend Developer" vs. "Senior Data Scientist."
  * **Trust & Accuracy:** All tasks are **grounded** with direct citations to specific internal documents, virtually eliminating hallucinations.
  * **Efficiency:** Drastically reduces the time new employees spend searching for relevant information.

## üöÄ Advanced Technical Features (Why this Project Stands Out)

This system is built to showcase several high-impact, advanced Generative AI techniques:

1.  **Dual-Retriever Architecture:** The core intelligence relies on orchestrating two parallel retrieval mechanisms:
      * **Task-Based Retriever:** Uses **metadata filtering** (`role_tag`, `topic_tag`) in the Vector Store to retrieve highly specific content (e.g., Python code standards, AWS setup guides).
      * **Persona-Based Retriever:** Uses standard semantic search to retrieve general examples of past successful onboarding plans to guide the final output *structure*.
2.  **Proactive Structured Generation:** The agent is designed for a complex generative task, not just reactive Q\&A. It is explicitly instructed to synthesize and sequence information into a cohesive schedule.
3.  **Pydantic Schema Validation:** Utilizes LangChain's **`PydanticOutputParser`** to strictly enforce the output format as a machine-readable JSON object (the `OnboardingPlan` schema). This ensures the output is reliable and production-ready for integration into HR systems.
4.  **LCEL Orchestration:** The entire workflow‚Äîfrom user input through dual retrieval, prompt construction, and output parsing‚Äîis chained together using the flexible and performant **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**.
